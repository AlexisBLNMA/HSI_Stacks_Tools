    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a powerful technique used in microscopy, food quality, satellites imaging, remote sensing, seed viability, environmental monitoring, among many other applications. In biological science and microscopy, HSI allows to obtain the fluorescence emission spectrum generally in the visible range. This leads directly to fluorescence microscopy, where a particular wavelength is used to reach a molecule's excitation spectrum. In microscopy, HSI uses the emission spectrum excited at a given wavelength to analyze and characterize molecules, organelles or cells. Further studies relate the uses of fluorophores bounded to molecules present at the cells and allow to observer different regions that normal microscopy techniques like widefield or brightfield cannot appreciate. The Phasor analysis is used in  HSI to obtain a phasor representation given by the complex Fourier Transform of each spectrum. Then the phasor plot analysis gives an easy and graphical way to analyze the components in the sample.\n",

    " ### 1.1 The Phasor Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering an hyperspectral image stack, the fluorescence spectra at each pixel can be transformed in phasor coordinates (G (位)) and (S (位)) as described in the following equations. I(位) represent the intensity at every wavelength (channel), n is the number of the harmonic and 位 i the initial wavelength. The, x and y coordinates are plotted in the spectral phasor plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pipeline1.png](pipeline1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure above shows the pipeline of the phasor analysis for each emission spectrum that is stored in the HSI stack. Let take $d=m$x$n$x$k$ the dimession of the stack, where $m$x$n$ is the dimession of each image and $k$ is the number of images or channels in the stack. So each pixel in the possion $(i,j)$ corresponds to the spectrum $I(\\lambda_{(i,j)})$. Each channel has an associated value of $\\lambda_k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equations G and S are the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\int_L I(\\lambda) cos\\left( 2\\pi n \\frac{\\lambda - \\lambda_i}{\\lambda_{max} - \\lambda_{min}} \\right)}{\\int_L I(\\lambda)d\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\int_L I(\\lambda) sen\\left( 2\\pi n \\frac{\\lambda - \\lambda_i}{\\lambda_{max} - \\lambda_{min}} \\right)}{\\int_L I(\\lambda)d\\lambda} j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Obs. These Equations are compute using the Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm of Numpy. Since $G$ and $S$ are a partcular case of the Fourier Transform $(FT)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then after obtaining $G$ and $S$ which correspond to the real and imaginary part of the $FT$ we obtain the phasor plot. Fionally we can relate each pixel in the phasor with a given color, or color scale in order to create a pseudcolor image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows this pipeline, from HSI stack to create a pseudocolor image. $G$ and $S$ are now Matrix (Images) that contain in each pixel $(i, j)$ the coordinate in the phasor. \n",
